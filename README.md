# Api

For the interview, I’m maintaining the initial structure I used at the start, which was the mellow interview setup. Essentially, the main app is an API that takes a file, sanitizes it, and then prints the content of the sanitized file. It also handles uploading the new file. Additionally, I've included some images that I'm testing.
